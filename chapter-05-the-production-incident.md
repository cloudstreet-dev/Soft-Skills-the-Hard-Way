# Chapter 5: The Production Incident

Alex's phone screamed at 3:17 AM on Sunday. The PagerDuty alert was maximum severity: production down, payment system unresponsive, estimated revenue loss $50,000 per minute.

By 3:19 AM, Alex was at their home desk, connected to the VPN, fingers already flying across the keyboard. The logs were a massacre of red text and stack traces.

The Slack channel #incidents exploded with messages:

**Rita**: I'm on. Database connections maxed out.  
**Marcus**: Test environment is fine. This is prod only.  
**James**: Getting calls from the CEO. ETA on fix?  
**Sarah**: On my way to office. Who's taking lead?

Before Alex could respond, another message appeared:

**Dr. Montgomery**: I'm seeing this from Florida. Check the lunar calendar.

Lunar calendar? What did that have to do with—

"Oh no," Alex said out loud, remembering Marcus's test case #447 that only ran on Tuesdays. But this was Sunday, and—

**Alex**: It's Lunar New Year in Singapore. Our Asian Pacific transactions just increased 10x.

**Dr. Montgomery**: Bingo. The system has a hardcoded connection pool of 100. Line 4,743 in TRNPOOL.CBL.

Alex pulled up the file. There it was, a comment from 1997: "100 connections should be enough for anybody - Carl"

**Rita**: I can't restart the connection pool without bringing down the entire system. We'd lose in-flight transactions.

**Marcus**: Estimated 47,000 transactions currently processing.

The Slack channel went quiet. Everyone knew what that meant: they could either lose the in-flight transactions or continue bleeding $50,000 per minute.

Alex's fingers hovered over the keyboard. In the old days, they would have made the call unilaterally—restart everything, accept the losses, fix it fast. But something Sarah had said echoed in their mind: "Great teams make decisions together, especially the hard ones."

**Alex**: Team decision needed. We can:  
1. Restart now, lose ~$2M in in-flight transactions  
2. Let it bleed, fix in place, lose ~$3M per hour  
3. Something else?

**Priya**: I'm here too. What about gradually draining connections?

**Sarah**: Explain, Priya.

**Priya**: We can't add more connections, but can we make existing ones more efficient? Process transactions faster?

**Dr. Montgomery**: Smart cookie. Check lines 5,012-5,089. There's a sleep statement.

Rita was already there:

**Rita**: Found it. 500ms sleep between each transaction "for system stability."

**Alex**: We remove that sleep, we might overwhelm downstream systems.

**Marcus**: I'm checking downstream capacity now... We have room. 70% utilization.

**Sarah**: Team vote. Remove the sleep statement? Rita can hot-patch without restart.

**Alex**: Yes  
**Rita**: Yes  
**Marcus**: Yes  
**James**: Do it  
**Priya**: Yes

Rita's fingers flew across her keyboard. The team watched the metrics dashboard like surgeons monitoring vital signs.

3:31 AM: Transaction processing speed doubled.  
3:33 AM: Queue depth decreasing.  
3:35 AM: Response times normalizing.  
3:37 AM: System stable.

**Sarah**: Brilliant work, everyone. Priya, that was inspired thinking.

**Priya**: I just asked what Alex would do, then thought of the opposite.

Despite the stress, everyone laughed.

**Dr. Montgomery**: In 1999, the same thing happened during Y2K testing. We fixed it the same way. Some lessons need to be learned twice. Good job, kids.

She went offline, leaving the team to handle the aftermath.

**Sarah**: All hands to the office at 9 AM for post-mortem. Bring breakfast. The company's buying.

By 4 AM, the system was fully stable. Alex should have gone back to bed but found themselves writing the incident report instead. Not the usual terse technical summary, but a detailed narrative that included Priya's insight, the team's collaborative decision-making, and Dr. Montgomery's institutional knowledge.

At 9 AM, the conference room was packed. The CEO was there, looking haggard but relieved. The entire engineering team, even people who weren't on call, had shown up.

Sarah ran the post-mortem with her usual grace, but she did something unexpected: she had Priya explain her solution.

The junior developer stood nervously at the whiteboard, drawing diagrams of connection pools and transaction flows. Her voice grew stronger as she explained her reasoning, and by the end, the CEO was nodding appreciatively.

"What would have happened if we'd just restarted?" the CEO asked.

"We'd have lost $2 million in transactions, damaged customer trust, and probably faced regulatory scrutiny," James explained. "Priya's solution saved us all of that."

"Give her a raise," the CEO said bluntly. "Give them all raises. And fix that connection pool limit."

After the CEO left, the team stayed to discuss the real fixes.

"We need to make the connection pool dynamic," Alex said.

"We need to remove all hardcoded limits," Rita added.

"We need to document every assumption in the system," Marcus said.

"We need to celebrate that we just handled our first major incident as a team," Sarah said, pulling out a bottle of champagne she'd somehow hidden in the conference room. "It's 10 AM, but I think we've earned it."

As Sarah poured small cups for everyone (even Alex accepted one), she raised a toast:

"To Priya, for fresh perspectives. To Dr. Montgomery, for institutional knowledge. To Rita, for nerves of steel during the hot-patch. To Marcus, for knowing every edge case. To James, for keeping the CEO calm. And to Alex, for recognizing that the best decision isn't always your decision—it's our decision."

Alex raised their cup, feeling something they couldn't quite name. Pride? Belonging? Connection?

"To the team," Alex said simply.

"To the team," everyone echoed.

Later, as they worked on the permanent fix, Alex found themselves naturally falling into the rhythm of collaboration. Asking Priya for her opinion. Running ideas past Marcus. Checking deployment implications with Rita.

The code they produced wasn't just Alex's brilliant solution implemented in isolation. It was better. It had Marcus's edge case handling, Rita's operational safeguards, Priya's fresh perspective on resource pooling, and James's understanding of business impact.

The commit message was a group effort too:

```
Fix: Dynamic connection pooling for high-volume transaction periods

Co-authored-by: Marcus Wong <marcus@technova.com>

Problem: Static connection pool limit caused system failure during 10x 
traffic spike (Lunar New Year).

Root Cause: Hardcoded limit of 100 connections from 1997, based on 
obsolete traffic patterns.

Solution: 
- Implemented dynamic connection pooling with auto-scaling
- Removed 500ms sleep between transactions (legacy stability measure)
- Added predictive scaling based on regional holiday calendars
- Created circuit breaker for downstream system protection

Testing:
- Load tested with 100x normal traffic
- Verified no downstream system overload
- Confirmed zero transaction loss during scaling events

Incident: INC-2024-0247
Revenue Impact Prevented: $2M
Time to Resolution: 18 minutes

Special thanks to Dr. E. Montgomery for historical context and remote assistance.

Note: This is why we don't use magic numbers, Carl.

As Alex pushed the commit, they realized something had fundamentally changed. They were no longer a brilliant individual contributor who happened to work near other people. They were part of something bigger—a team that was greater than the sum of its parts.

It was terrifying.

It was also exhilarating.
