# Chapter 2: First Stand-up

Alex's morning routine was precise: wake at 6:47 AM (studies showed 7 hours and 47 minutes was optimal sleep), black coffee at 6:52, arrive at the office at 7:23 to get three solid hours of coding before the rest of the team arrived.

But at 7:24 AM on Wednesday, the routine shattered.

"Oh good, you're here early too!" 

Alex nearly dropped their coffee. A woman stood by the elevator, holding what appeared to be a box of donuts and wearing a smile that was entirely too enthusiastic for this hour.

"I'm Sarah Martinez, the new VP of Engineering. You must be Alex Chen! I've heard amazing things about your code."

Alex nodded, desperately calculating the minimum viable social interaction required to escape to their desk.

"I brought donuts for the team meeting," Sarah continued, seemingly immune to Alex's obvious discomfort. "Speaking of which, we're moving stand-up to 8 AM starting today. In person. I want everyone there before the coffee kicks in—people are more honest when they're slightly grumpy."

"I usually dial in," Alex managed.

"Not anymore!" Sarah's cheerfulness was weapons-grade. "Face-to-face communication is 93% more effective. I read a study."

Alex knew that study. It was about emotional communication, not technical discussions. The methodology was questionable at best. But Sarah was already walking toward the conference room, leaving Alex no choice but to follow or appear insubordinate on her first day.

The conference room filled quickly. Alex recognized most faces but knew few names. There was the QA person who always found edge cases, the DevOps engineer who wore exclusively band t-shirts, and the project manager who somehow survived entirely on energy drinks.

"Good morning, everyone!" Sarah stood at the whiteboard, uncapping a marker with unnecessary flourish. "I know change is hard, but I promise this will be worth it. We're going to do stand-ups a little differently."

She drew three columns: Yesterday, Today, Blockers.

"Standard stuff, but here's the twist—we're going to actually listen to each other. Radical concept, I know."

Nervous laughter rippled through the room.

"Who wants to go first?" Sarah asked.

Silence.

"Alex! Perfect. Tell us about yesterday."

Alex's throat went dry. "Fixed the payment processing bug."

"Excellent! How did you find it?"

"Stack trace analysis and code review."

"Did anyone help?"

"No."

Sarah's smile never wavered. "And today?"

"Starting the COBOL migration project."

"Wonderful! Any blockers?"

"No."

Sarah wrote something on the board. Alex couldn't see what, but several team members leaned forward with interest.

The stand-up continued around the room. The QA person—Marcus, apparently—mentioned struggling with test coverage on the legacy system. The DevOps engineer, Rita, complained about the ancient deployment pipeline. The project manager, James, made a joke about needing a translator for the COBOL documentation.

"Interesting," Sarah said when everyone had spoken. "Alex, you're starting the COBOL migration. James needs COBOL documentation translated. Marcus needs better test coverage for legacy systems. Rita needs to modernize the deployment pipeline for the migration. Does anyone else see the pattern?"

Alex saw it immediately but remained silent.

"You're all working on the same project from different angles," Sarah continued. "But nobody mentioned collaborating. Alex, when were you planning to talk to Rita about deployment requirements?"

"I... hadn't planned to. I assumed I'd hand off the code when ready."

"And Marcus, when were you going to discuss test strategies with Alex?"

Marcus shrugged. "I figured I'd write tests after the code was done."

Sarah's marker squeaked against the whiteboard as she drew lines connecting everyone's tasks.

"Here's my first executive decision: Alex, you're pairing with Marcus today on test-driven development for the migration. Rita, join them after lunch to design the deployment pipeline together. James, you're their product owner—sit with them and translate requirements in real-time."

"Pairing?" Alex's voice cracked slightly. "I work more efficiently alone."

"Do you though?" Sarah's question was gentle but pointed. "You fixed that payment bug in three days. How long would it have taken with Marcus catching edge cases as you coded?"

Alex wanted to argue but couldn't. The bug had been an edge case.

"Look," Sarah said, addressing the room but looking at Alex. "I know this is uncomfortable. I know some of you became engineers specifically to avoid this much human interaction. But here's the thing—we're not just writing code. We're building products that real people depend on. And that requires us to actually talk to each other."

She capped the marker with finality.

"Pair programming starts today. Rotate pairs every two days. Daily stand-ups at 8 AM sharp. And yes, cameras on for remote folks. My camera-shy friends, I bought ring lights for everyone. They're in the supply closet."

The meeting dispersed with a mixture of grumbling and curious excitement. Alex lingered, hoping to make a final case for solo work.

"Alex," Sarah said before they could speak. "I read your code from last night. It's brilliant. Genuinely. But your commit message was three words. How is anyone supposed to understand your thought process?"

"The code is self-documenting."

"For other people at your level, maybe. But what about junior developers? What about future you, six months from now?"

Alex hadn't considered that.

"Give pairing a chance," Sarah said. "One week. If your velocity actually decreases, we'll revisit. Deal?"

It wasn't really a question, but Alex nodded anyway.

Walking to their desk, Alex found Marcus already there, setting up a second chair and keyboard.

"I promise I don't bite," Marcus said with a grin. "And I brought good headphones so we can each listen to our own music while we work. Sarah didn't say we had to talk constantly."

Maybe, Alex thought, this wouldn't be completely terrible.

"So," Marcus continued, pulling up the COBOL documentation, "I've actually been studying this beast for two weeks. Want to know what I found?"

Despite themselves, Alex leaned forward with interest. "What?"

"This system has been running for thirty years without a major incident. The original developer left comments. Really good ones. Look at this..."

As Marcus began explaining the elegant simplicity hidden beneath the COBOL's verbose syntax, Alex felt something unexpected: curiosity about someone else's perspective.

It was unsettling.

It was also, Alex reluctantly admitted, kind of interesting.
