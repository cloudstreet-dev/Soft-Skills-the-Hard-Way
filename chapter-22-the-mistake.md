# Chapter 22: The Mistake

Alex's biggest mistake at The Human Stack Foundation didn't involve code. It involved people.

"We need to let David go," Sarah said during their weekly one-on-one.

"David? But he's brilliant. His workshop on distributed systems thinking is the highest-rated session we have."

"He's also toxic. Three participants have complained about his behavior outside of sessions. He's reverting to old patterns—dismissive, arrogant, creating the very culture we're trying to fix."

Alex felt defensive. They'd personally recruited David, a former colleague who'd shown interest in the foundation's mission.

"Maybe he just needs coaching. Like Brad needed. Like I needed."

"Not everyone wants to change, Alex. And we can't sacrifice our participants' psychological safety for one instructor's potential."

"Give me a month. Let me work with him."

Sarah studied Alex carefully. "This isn't about David, is it? This is about you believing everyone can transform because you did."

"Isn't that what we teach?"

"We teach that everyone has the capacity to change. Not that everyone will choose to change."

Alex insisted on the month. It was a mistake that would cost them dearly.

The first warning sign came during a joint teaching session. David interrupted Alex mid-explanation.

"That's unnecessarily complex," David said to the room. "Let me show you the right way."

The participants looked uncomfortable as David rewrote Alex's example, adding clever optimizations that obscured the lesson about clarity over cleverness.

"David," Alex said carefully, "the point is readability, not efficiency."

"Readable code is for mediocre programmers," David replied.

The room went silent. Several participants looked at their phones, clearly uncomfortable.

After the session, Alex pulled David aside.

"That was inappropriate. You undermined the lesson and insulted the participants."

"I improved the lesson. If they can't handle optimization, they shouldn't be here."

"David, we're teaching collaboration, not competition."

"Same thing. Competition makes everyone better."

Alex spent the next week trying to coach David, sharing their own transformation story, explaining the foundation's philosophy. David nodded along but didn't change.

The second incident was worse. During a workshop on psychological safety, David publicly humiliated a participant who asked a basic question.

"Seriously? You're a senior engineer and you don't know event-loop architecture? How did you even get hired?"

The participant, a woman named Rosa who'd traveled from Mexico City for the workshop, went silent. She didn't speak for the rest of the session.

Marcus, who was co-teaching, intervened immediately.

"David, hall. Now."

"I'm teaching," David protested.

"No, you're bullying. Hall. Now."

Alex found them arguing outside.

"He's destroying everything we're building," Marcus said.

"I'm maintaining standards," David countered. "Not everyone deserves to be here."

"Everyone deserves respect," Alex said firmly. "Apologize to Rosa."

"For telling the truth?"

That evening, Rosa requested a private meeting with Alex.

"I'm leaving the workshop," she said quietly.

"Please don't. David was wrong—"

"It's not just David. It's that he felt comfortable saying that here. At the place that's supposed to be different."

Alex felt sick. "You're right. I failed you. I brought David here, and I let him stay after the first warning signs."

"Why?"

Alex was quiet for a moment. "Because I wanted to believe everyone could change. Because I changed."

"But you wanted to change," Rosa said. "David doesn't. He wants to be right."

She left that night. Her team went with her.

Sarah called an emergency meeting.

"David's gone," she announced. "Effective immediately."

"You can't fire me," David said. "Alex hired me."

"And Alex was wrong," Sarah replied. "This isn't a debate. Security will escort you out."

David looked at Alex for support. Alex wanted to offer it, still believing in redemption, but Rosa's words echoed: "He wants to be right."

"I'm sorry, David. This isn't working."

David's exit was ugly. He posted on social media about the foundation's "hypocritical culture of mediocrity." He started his own competing workshops, promising "real engineering excellence without the feelings."

"I failed," Alex told Sarah that evening.

"Yes, you did. Tell me why."

"I projected my journey onto someone else. I assumed everyone had the same capacity for growth."

"And?"

"And I prioritized potential redemption over actual harm. Rosa and her team suffered because I wanted to play savior."

Sarah nodded. "The hardest lesson in leadership isn't learning to help people change. It's learning that you can't change people who don't want to change."

Alex wrote a public apology. Not a corporate non-apology, but a real acknowledgment of failure:

"I compromised our values by keeping someone who violated them. I prioritized one person's potential over many people's safety. Rosa and her team deserved better. We failed them. I failed them. Here's what we're changing..."

The response was mixed. Some praised the honesty. Others, particularly David's supporters, attacked the foundation for "cancel culture."

But Rosa responded:

"Thank you for the apology. Real growth means admitting real mistakes. I'm willing to try again."

She returned for the next workshop, bringing her team and three others.

"Why come back?" Alex asked her.

"Because you admitted you were wrong and changed things. That's exactly what you teach. You just had to learn it at a different level."

The foundation implemented new policies. Stricter vetting for instructors. Clear codes of conduct. Most importantly, a commitment that psychological safety wasn't negotiable, even for brilliant assholes.

"We lost six teams to David's competing workshops," James reported at the quarterly review.

"Good," Sarah said, surprising everyone. "If they prefer his approach, they wouldn't thrive with ours anyway."

But the real test came when Brad suggested something during a planning session:

"We should invite David to a public debate. Show the difference between our approaches."

"Absolutely not," Alex said immediately. "We don't platform toxicity, even to refute it."

"But we could destroy his arguments—"

"We could also legitimize them by engaging. Some battles aren't worth fighting. Some people aren't worth saving."

Brad looked surprised. "That's harsh, coming from you."

"That's learned, coming from me. I used to think every problem had a solution if you were smart enough. But some problems are people choosing to be problems."

Marcus added, "The opposite of psychological safety isn't just hostility. It's also enabling hostility through inaction."

The David incident became a teaching case study. Not of redemption, but of recognition—recognizing when someone's behavior is incompatible with your values, regardless of their talent.

"But how do you know when someone can't change?" a participant asked during a workshop.

"You don't," Alex admitted. "But you can observe whether they're trying to change. David never tried. He just pretended to listen while waiting to be right again."

Six months later, David's workshops folded. Without the foundation's collaborative culture, his brilliant asshole approach attracted only other brilliant assholes, and they eventually turned on each other.

"I feel bad for him," Alex admitted to Sarah.

"Feeling bad for someone doesn't mean enabling them," Sarah replied. "Compassion without boundaries is just self-destruction."

The foundation grew stronger from the failure. The clarity about values, the commitment to safety over brilliance, the understanding that not everyone belonged in every space—these lessons made their teaching more honest.

"We can't save everyone," Alex said during a workshop on cultural transformation. "But we can save the ones who want to be saved. And we can protect the space for those who are trying to grow."

A participant raised their hand. "What about second chances?"

"Everyone deserves a second chance. Not everyone earns a third. And when someone shows you who they are repeatedly, believe them."

Rosa, who had joined as a guest instructor, added, "The tech industry has too many brilliant assholes already. We don't need to create more opportunities for them. We need to create opportunities for brilliant humans."

The applause was immediate and sustained.

That night, Alex looked at the photo wall in the foundation office—hundreds of teams who'd graduated from their workshops. Rosa's team was there, smiling, transformed.

David wasn't there. And that was the right choice.

"Not every story has a redemption arc," Alex wrote in their journal. "Sometimes the growth is in recognizing who can't grow with you."

It was perhaps the hardest lesson they'd learned.

It was also one of the most important.
