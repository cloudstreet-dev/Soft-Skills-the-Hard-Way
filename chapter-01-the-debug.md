# Chapter 1: The Debug

Alex Chen stared at the stack trace on their third monitor, the one positioned at exactly 27 degrees for optimal neck ergonomics. The error message mocked them in angry red text:

```
NullPointerException at line 1337
```

Of course it was line 1337. Even the universe was trolling them at 2:47 AM on a Tuesday.

The office was empty except for the gentle hum of servers and the occasional whir of the ancient coffee machine that IT kept threatening to replace but never did. Alex preferred it this way. No interruptions, no small talk about weekend plans, no mandatory "team building" exercises that always seemed to involve trust falls or escape rooms.

Just code. Pure, logical, predictable code.

Alex's fingers flew across the mechanical keyboardâ€”a Das Keyboard 4 Professional with Cherry MX Brown switches, naturally. The satisfying clicks echoed through the empty floor of TechNova Industries, a mid-sized fintech company that had somehow survived three economic downturns and two failed acquisitions.

"Got you," Alex muttered, spotting the race condition that had been plaguing the payment processing system for three days. A few keystrokes later, the fix was in place. Unit tests: green. Integration tests: green. The satisfaction was almost physical.

Alex pushed the commit with a message that simply read: "Fixed bug."

The walk to the parking garage was peaceful. No forced conversations in the elevator, no awkward encounters at the coffee machine. Just the way Alex liked it. Tomorrow was Wednesday, which meant the weekly team stand-up that Alex habitually attended via audio only, camera perpetually "broken."

The drive home through the empty streets of Seattle gave Alex time to think about the new project starting next week. Something about "digital transformation" and "agile methodology." Corporate buzzword bingo, as usual. But the technical challenge sounded interesting: migrating a legacy COBOL system to microservices. Finally, something worthy of Alex's talents.

At home, Alex's apartment was exactly what you'd expect: minimal furniture, maximum monitors. A standing desk dominated the living room, surrounded by programming books arranged by language and then by publication date. The kitchen contained exactly three items: a coffee maker, a microwave, and a collection of Soylent bottles.

Before bed, Alex checked GitHub one more time. The commit had already been reviewed and merged by someone in the London office. No comments, no suggestions. Perfect code needs no explanation.

As sleep finally came, Alex felt that familiar satisfaction of a problem solved, a bug squashed, a system optimized. Tomorrow would bring new challenges, new code to write, new problems to solve.

What Alex didn't know was that tomorrow would also bring Sarah Martinez, the new VP of Engineering, and her radical ideas about "collaborative development" and "psychological safety." Tomorrow would bring the announcement that would change everything: mandatory pair programming.

But tonight, in the glow of three monitors and the satisfaction of clean code, Alex Chen slept peacefully, blissfully unaware that their carefully constructed world of solitary coding excellence was about to be turned completely upside down.

The last thought before sleep was the same as always: "There's no problem that can't be solved with good code."

If only life were that simple.
