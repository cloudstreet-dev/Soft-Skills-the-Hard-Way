# Chapter 9: The Offsite

The cabin was a three-hour drive from Seattle, nestled in the Cascade Mountains with no cell service and—Alex had verified this three times—absolutely no WiFi.

"This is insane," Alex muttered, sitting in the back of the van Sarah had rented. "What if there's an emergency?"

"There's a landline," Sarah said from the driver's seat. "For actual emergencies. Production being five milliseconds slower than usual doesn't count."

The team had carpooled, and Alex was trapped between Marcus (who had brought a guitar for some reason) and Priya (who was reading a book about psychological safety in teams and occasionally highlighting passages with concerning enthusiasm).

"Has anyone noticed," Brad said from the front passenger seat, "that Sarah's taking us to an isolated cabin with no communication? This is how horror movies start."

"If I wanted to eliminate you all," Sarah said cheerfully, "I'd just make you use JIRA."

Everyone shuddered.

The cabin was rustic but comfortable. Six bedrooms, a large common area with a fireplace, and a kitchen that James immediately colonized.

"I'm cooking tonight," he announced. "Real food, not Soylent or energy drinks."

"I don't trust food I can't read the nutritional label for," Alex said.

"You'll trust my grandmother's Irish stew," James replied. "It's got three ingredients: meat, potatoes, and love."

"Love isn't an ingredient."

"That's why your code has no soul," Marcus said, then immediately looked horrified. "Sorry, that came out meaner than—"

Alex surprised everyone by laughing. "My code has no soul? That's the best insult I've heard in years."

Sarah gathered everyone in the living room, where she'd set up a whiteboard she'd somehow smuggled in.

"Okay, ground rules. No laptops, no coding, no checking GitHub on your phones—yes, Brad, I saw you trying to get signal by the window. We're here to think about the future, not fix the present."

"What are we supposed to do without computers?" Alex asked, genuinely confused.

Sarah pulled out a deck of cards, board games, and—Alex's nightmare—team building exercises.

"We're going to talk. Plan. Dream. And yes, play some games that don't involve keyboards."

The first exercise was "Two Truths and a Lie." Alex wanted to disappear into the floorboards.

Sarah started: "I have a master's in organizational psychology, I once debugged code for NASA, and I speak four languages."

After much debate, they determined the lie was NASA—it was SpaceX.

Marcus went next: "I won a national piano competition at 12, I've never seen Star Wars, and my first program was a recipe database for my grandmother."

"Star Wars has to be the lie," Brad said. "Every programmer has seen Star Wars."

"Nope," Marcus said. "Never interested me."

Brad looked personally offended.

When Alex's turn came, they froze. Personal information felt like giving away passwords.

"I..." Alex started, then stopped. The team waited patiently.

"I have a perfect GPA from MIT, I've been coding since I was seven, and I used to perform stand-up comedy in college."

Everyone immediately said "stand-up comedy," but Rita studied Alex carefully.

"No," she said. "The lie is coding since seven. I bet it was later."

Alex nodded, surprised. "Nine. I lied to make myself sound more prodigious."

"Stand-up comedy?" Sarah asked, delighted. "Really?"

"Only for one semester. I was terrible. Turns out explaining why jokes are technically funny doesn't make them funnier."

Everyone laughed, and Alex found themselves telling the story of their worst bombing, complete with self-deprecating commentary that had the team in stitches.

The afternoon shifted to planning. Sarah had them envision the team in five years.

"Still maintaining COBOL," Brad said, getting groans.

"Running the entire division," James suggested.

"Building something that matters," Priya said quietly.

"What do you mean?" Sarah asked.

"The transaction system is important, but it's not... meaningful. I want to build something that helps people directly."

"Like what?" Alex asked, genuinely curious.

"My cousin has diabetes. Managing insulin and blood sugar is incredibly complex. What if we built something that made it simple?"

The conversation evolved organically. Rita talked about her mother's struggle with banking as an immigrant. Marcus shared his nephew's challenges with learning disabilities and educational software. Brad, surprisingly, opened up about his father's Alzheimer's and the lack of good tools for memory assistance.

"We have the skills," Alex said slowly. "We could build any of these."

"As side projects?" James asked.

"As our next product," Sarah said. "After the migration, TechNova needs a new direction. What if it's one of these?"

The discussion continued through dinner (James's stew was, annoyingly, delicious) and into the evening. They'd moved to the fireplace, and Marcus had brought out his guitar, playing softly in the background.

"Can I share something?" Alex said suddenly, surprising themselves.

Everyone turned to listen.

"Six weeks ago, I would have quit if forced to come on this trip. The thought of two days without coding, without problems to solve, terrified me. But this... this is problem-solving. Just with people instead of computers."

"People are harder to debug," Brad said.

"But more rewarding to understand," Alex replied.

Sarah pulled out a bottle of wine she'd hidden. "I have a confession. This offsite wasn't just about team building. I've been offered a job at Amazon. VP of Engineering for AWS."

The room went silent. Marcus's guitar stopped.

"It's three times my current salary," Sarah continued. "Stock options. The works."

"You're leaving?" Priya's voice was small.

"I haven't decided. That's why we're here. I needed to see if what we've built is real or just temporary harmony."

"It's real," Alex said firmly. "Six weeks ago, I couldn't have said that. But watching Brad transform, seeing Priya find her voice, experiencing actual collaboration—it's real."

"But is it sustainable without me?" Sarah asked.

"Yes," everyone said simultaneously, then looked surprised at their unanimity.

"You've taught us the principles," Rita said. "Psychological safety, collaborative decision-making, knowledge sharing. We don't need you to enforce them anymore. We believe in them."

"Alex could be team lead," Marcus suggested.

"Absolutely not," Alex said. "I'm barely functional as a human. But we could rotate. Different lead each sprint."

"That's... actually brilliant," Sarah said.

They spent the rest of the evening planning how the team would function if Sarah left. But the more they planned, the more it became clear they wanted her to stay.

"What would make you stay?" Brad asked directly.

Sarah thought for a moment. "Autonomy to run the team my way. Budget for training and conferences. And support for building one of these meaningful projects we discussed."

"So ask for it," James said. "Tom likes you. The team's productivity is up 40%. We just landed MegaBank. You have leverage."

The next day was less structured. They hiked to a waterfall, where Alex discovered they were afraid of heights but did the trail anyway because the team encouraged them. They played board games, where Priya destroyed everyone at Settlers of Catan with a strategy so ruthless that Brad called her "terrifyingly brilliant."

That evening, sitting around the fire again, Sarah made an announcement.

"I'm staying. But I'm negotiating everything we discussed. Including funding for a skunkworks project to build something meaningful."

The team erupted in celebration. Even Alex, who usually avoided physical contact, accepted the group hug that followed.

"But," Sarah continued, "I need something from each of you. A commitment to keep growing. Alex, that means more customer calls. Brad, more mentoring. Marcus, I want you to speak at a testing conference. Rita, write that blog post about deployment strategies. Priya, pair with juniors from other teams. James, teach a course on business requirements at the local college."

"That's terrifying," they all said in various ways.

"Good. Growth is terrifying. Stagnation is death."

On the drive back, Alex sat in the same spot but felt like a different person. The lack of internet hadn't killed them. The team interactions had energized rather than drained them. They'd even enjoyed the hiking, despite the heights.

"Hey Alex," Priya said quietly. "Thank you for backing my idea about meaningful projects."

"It was a good idea."

"No, I mean thank you for making me feel like my ideas matter. Six weeks ago, you didn't know my name."

"I'm sorry about that."

"Don't be sorry. Be better. You're being better."

As Seattle's skyline came into view, Alex felt something they'd never experienced returning from a trip: disappointment that it was over.

Their phone exploded with notifications as soon as they got signal. But instead of immediately diving into emails and Slack messages, Alex looked at the team.

"Same time next year?"

"Already booked the cabin," Sarah said with a wink.

Walking into the office Monday morning felt different. The team had shared something beyond code, beyond work. They'd shared themselves.

At the morning standup, Alex did something unprecedented: they went first.

"Friday: Discovered I'm afraid of heights but good at Settlers of Catan. Today: Implementing Priya's connection pooling optimization and starting documentation for our skunkworks project. Blockers: None, unless you count my lingering fear of that waterfall trail."

Everyone laughed. The team that had gone to the mountains had come back stronger, closer, and ready to build something that mattered.

And Alex, who had dreaded every moment of the trip, was already counting the days until the next one.
