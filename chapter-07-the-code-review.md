# Chapter 7: The Code Review

"This is garbage."

The words hung in the air of Conference Room B like a toxic cloud. Everyone stared at the screen where Brad, the senior architect who'd been on vacation for two weeks, was systematically destroying the team's migration code in the pull request comments.

"Line 47: Amateur hour. Who uses a for loop here?"  
"Line 92: This is why we can't have nice things."  
"Line 134: Did you even read the style guide?"  
"General: Reject and rewrite. This wouldn't pass a junior interview."

Alex felt something unexpected: protective anger. Not for their own code, but for Priya's elegant connection pooling solution that Brad had just called "amateur hour."

"Brad," Sarah's voice was dangerously calm. "Conference room. Now."

Brad swaggered in five minutes later, coffee in hand, looking pleased with himself.

"Good to see someone still maintains standards while I'm gone," he said, dropping into a chair.

"Whose code did you just review?" Sarah asked.

"Does it matter? It's all subpar. The transaction validator is especially bad. Nested conditions instead of a strategy pattern? Come on."

"That transaction validator handles 47 different regulatory requirements," Alex said quietly. "Each condition is documented with the specific regulation it addresses."

Brad turned to Alex. "Oh, you wrote it? Figures. You always over-complicate things."

"Actually," Marcus said, "we all wrote it. That's why it has five co-authors."

"Group code is always worse than‚Äî"

"Brad." Sarah's interruption was sharp. "The code you just trashed processed 10 million transactions yesterday with zero errors. It recovered from a production incident in 18 minutes that would have cost us $2 million. It's been running for a week with 100% uptime."

"Still doesn't follow best practices."

"Whose best practices?" Rita asked. "The connection pooling you called amateur hour is based on a paper from Netflix's engineering blog. Published last month."

Brad's confidence wavered slightly. "I haven't seen that paper."

"Because you don't read other people's code or ideas," Priya said quietly. It was the first time she'd directly challenged a senior engineer. "You just impose your patterns regardless of context."

The room went silent. Brad's face turned red.

"Listen, junior‚Äî"

"Her name is Priya," Alex interrupted, standing up. "And her connection pooling solution saved the company $2 million. What did your last code review accomplish besides making people feel bad?"

Brad looked around the room for support and found none.

Sarah pulled up the git history on the screen. "Brad, in the last year, you've approved exactly three pull requests. You've requested changes on 247. Of those, 89 were abandoned because the developers gave up trying to meet your shifting standards."

She clicked to another screen.

"Here's the interesting part. The abandoned PRs? When other reviewers eventually approved similar changes, those features generated $3.2 million in revenue. Features you blocked for style violations."

Brad shifted uncomfortably.

"Code review isn't about proving you're the smartest person in the room," Sarah continued. "It's about making the code better together. Alex, show Brad the commit message for the transaction validator."

Alex pulled it up, showing the detailed explanation of why each approach was chosen, what alternatives were considered, and how the team had decided together.

"This is what good code review produces," Sarah said. "Shared understanding, documented decisions, and code that the entire team can maintain."

"But the style guide‚Äî"

"Was written in 2019 by someone who doesn't work here anymore," James interrupted. "We've been following it blindly while the world moved on."

Sarah stood up. "Here's what's going to happen. Brad, you're going to pair with each team member for a half day. You're going to learn why they made their choices. Then you're going to help update the style guide to reflect modern practices and our actual needs."

"And if I refuse?"

"Then you can explain to the CEO why you're blocking the migration that's saving us $400,000 per month in infrastructure costs."

Brad left without another word.

The team sat in uncomfortable silence until Priya spoke up.

"Did I go too far?"

"No," everyone said simultaneously.

"Brad's been a gatekeeper for years," Rita said. "Someone needed to call him out."

"What if he retaliates?" Priya asked.

"Then he'll deal with me," Sarah said. "But I don't think he will. Brad's not evil, he's scared. The technology moved past him and he's using code reviews to maintain relevance."

She pulled up a new screen showing code review statistics.

"Look at this. When Brad started five years ago, his reviews were helpful. Collaborative. Something changed about two years ago‚Äîright when we started adopting microservices, which he never learned."

"So he became a style nazi instead of admitting he didn't understand the architecture," Marcus said.

"Exactly. Alex, I want you to pair with Brad first."

"Why me?"

"Because a month ago, you were him. Brilliant, isolated, and convinced that solo excellence was the path to success. Show him there's another way."

The next morning, Alex found Brad at his desk, surrounded by three monitors displaying the code he'd criticized.

"I read the commit messages," Brad said without looking up. "All of them. Even the ones explaining why you used for loops instead of map functions."

"And?"

"The for loops are more readable for junior developers. Map functions would be more elegant but harder to debug." Brad sounded pained admitting it.

"Priya pointed that out," Alex said, sitting down. "She was right."

Brad finally looked at Alex. "When did you become a team player? You were the lone wolf. The 3 AM hero. Like me."

"I was," Alex admitted. "Then Sarah showed me what I was missing. Want to see something?"

Alex pulled up the production metrics from the past month. All green, but that wasn't the interesting part.

"Look at the deployment frequency," Alex said. "We went from weekly to daily. Look at the bug count‚Äîdown 60%. Look at the team satisfaction scores."

"You measure satisfaction?" Brad sounded skeptical.

"Sarah does. Anonymous weekly surveys. One question: 'How fulfilled do you feel by your work?' Scores are up 40% since we started pairing and collaborative reviews."

Brad was quiet for a moment. "My satisfaction score would be pretty low."

"Mine was too. Turns out being right all the time is exhausting and lonely."

They spent the morning going through the code together. Alex explained each decision, but more importantly, who had contributed what insight. Brad began asking questions instead of making pronouncements.

"This error handling," Brad said, pointing at a section. "It's verbose, but... actually comprehensive."

"Rita wrote that. She's seen every possible failure mode in production. Each handler addresses a real incident."

"And this optimization?"

"Marcus noticed we were calling the database twice. Priya suggested caching. I implemented it. James verified it didn't violate any regulations. Team effort."

By lunch, Brad had submitted his first constructive code review in two years:

"The transaction validator elegantly balances regulatory requirements with performance needs. The nested conditions, while seemingly complex, provide clear traceability to specific regulations. Consider adding a comment block summarizing the validation flow for newcomers. Approved with suggestions."

The team's Slack channel lit up:

**Marcus**: Did Brad just... give constructive feedback?  
**Rita**: And approve something?  
**Priya**: With actual helpful suggestions?  
**James**: I'm checking for flying pigs.

**Brad**: I can see Slack on my third monitor, you know.

**Marcus**: üòÖ

**Brad**: But seriously, I owe you all an apology. Especially you, Priya. Your connection pooling is clever. I didn't understand it, so I attacked it. That was wrong.

**Priya**: Thank you. Want me to walk you through the Netflix paper?

**Brad**: I'd like that.

Sarah added a reaction: ‚ù§Ô∏è

That afternoon, something remarkable happened. Brad submitted a pull request‚Äîhis first in six months. It was a refactor of an old authentication module he'd been maintaining alone.

"I could use some eyes on this," he wrote in the description. "Particularly around the session management. Not my strongest area."

The team rallied. Marcus suggested test cases. Rita pointed out deployment considerations. Priya found an edge case. James verified compliance. Alex pair-programmed with Brad to implement the suggestions.

The code that emerged was better than anything Brad had written alone.

"Is this what it's been like for you all?" Brad asked Alex as they pushed the final commit. "This collaboration thing?"

"Pretty much."

"I've wasted two years being a gatekeeping asshole."

"Yeah, but you're recovering now. That's what matters."

Brad looked at his screens, then did something unprecedented: he turned two of them off.

"I don't need three monitors to prove I'm valuable," he said. "I need to actually be valuable to the team."

That evening, as the team was leaving, Brad called out, "Who wants to grab a beer? First round's on me. I have two years of being a jerk to apologize for."

Everyone went. Even Alex.

At the bar, Brad raised his glass. "To code reviews that build up instead of tear down."

"To psychological safety," Sarah added.

"To admitting when you don't know something," Priya said, looking at Brad.

"To learning from each other," Marcus added.

"To documentation that explains why, not just what," James contributed.

"To finding out that team code can be better than solo code," Rita said.

Everyone looked at Alex.

"To discovering that being right isn't as important as being helpful," Alex said.

They clinked glasses. Brad's eyes were suspiciously wet.

"Thank you," he said quietly. "For not giving up on me."

"That's what teams do," Sarah said simply.

As they drank and talked, sharing war stories and laughing about past mistakes, Alex realized something: Brad's transformation wasn't just about him. It was proof that anyone could change, could grow, could learn to value collaboration over isolation.

Even the most brilliant jerks could become team players.

Even Alex.
