# Chapter 11: The Conference

"I'm not going," Alex said, staring at the conference registration Sarah had just forwarded. "DevCon Seattle. Twenty thousand attendees. That's literally my worst nightmare."

"You're speaking," Sarah said calmly.

Alex's coffee mug stopped halfway to their mouth. "I'm what now?"

"Speaking. Saturday, 2 PM. 'From COBOL to Microservices: A Team's Journey.' Forty-five minutes, main stage."

"Main stage?" Alex's voice cracked. "That's... that's thousands of people."

"Three thousand, typically. But don't worry, it'll be recorded, so millions might watch it later."

Alex stood up so fast their chair rolled backward. "I need to quit. Right now. Today."

"Sit down," Sarah said, not unkindly. "Marcus is doing it with you. Joint presentation. He'll handle the testing aspects, you'll cover the technical architecture."

"That's worse! Now I can disappoint Marcus too!"

Marcus appeared, looking equally panicked. "Sarah just told me. I've already thrown up twice."

"See?" Alex said. "We're not ready for this."

"You have two months to prepare," Sarah said. "I've hired a speaking coach. The company's paying for everything. This is an opportunity to share what we've learned."

"What if I freeze? What if I forget everything? What if they ask questions I can't answer?"

"Then you'll be human," Sarah said. "Which, coincidentally, is what makes your story worth telling."

The next two months were torture. The speaking coach, a terrifyingly cheerful woman named Diana, made them practice in increasingly uncomfortable situations. First, to each other. Then to the team. Then to random groups of employees Sarah conscripted.

"Stop looking at your slides," Diana said for the hundredth time. "The slides are for the audience, not for you."

"But what if I forget—"

"Then Marcus jumps in. That's why there are two of you."

Marcus and Alex developed a rhythm. Alex would explain the technical challenges, Marcus would humanize them with stories about testing disasters and victories. They practiced transitions until they could finish each other's sentences.

"You're getting good at this," Jordan said, visiting from college to watch a practice session. "Almost like you enjoy it."

"I'd rather debug COBOL with a pencil and paper," Alex muttered.

The day of the conference arrived like an execution date. The convention center was massive, teeming with developers in tech t-shirts and laptop bags. Alex wanted to hide in the bathroom until it was over.

"Look," Marcus said, pointing at the schedule board. Their talk was highlighted. "We're featured. People actually want to hear us."

"People want to hear about disaster. We're the disaster."

But as they walked through the vendor hall, something interesting happened. A developer recognized Alex from their blog posts.

"You're Alex Chen! Your post about commit messages changed how our entire team documents code!"

Before Alex could respond, another person joined them. "Wait, you're the team that migrated that thirty-year-old COBOL system? We're facing the same challenge. Can I ask you some questions?"

Suddenly, Alex and Marcus were surrounded by developers asking genuine questions, sharing similar problems, seeking advice. It wasn't networking—it was problem-solving with peers.

"This is actually... nice," Marcus whispered during a break.

"Don't jinx it," Alex whispered back.

At 1:45 PM, they stood backstage. Alex could hear the crowd, thousands of voices creating a dull roar. Their hands were shaking.

"I can't do this," Alex said.

"Yes, you can," Marcus said, though he looked ready to pass out too.

Diana appeared. "Remember, you're not performing. You're sharing. Talk to them like you'd talk to your team."

"My team is seven people!"

"Pretend the lights are bright and you can only see seven people. It works."

Sarah materialized with the rest of the team. "We'll be in the front row," she said. "If you get scared, look at us."

"What if I humiliate myself?" Alex asked.

"Then we'll humiliate ourselves too," Brad said. "I brought tomatoes to throw at you if you get too technical."

Despite their terror, Alex laughed.

The announcer's voice boomed: "Please welcome Alex Chen and Marcus Wong from TechNova Industries!"

The walk to the podium felt like miles. The lights were indeed blinding. Alex could barely see past the first few rows, where their team sat smiling encouragingly.

Marcus started, his voice shaky but growing stronger: "Six months ago, if you'd told me I'd be standing here, I'd have laughed. If you'd told me Alex would be standing next to me, voluntarily talking to humans, I'd have checked you for head trauma."

The audience laughed. Alex felt something loosen in their chest.

"But here we are," Alex said, finding their voice. "Two introverts who learned that the hardest part of software isn't the software. It's the people. And that's not a bug—it's a feature."

The presentation flowed. They told stories: the production incident, Dr. Montgomery's visit, Brad's transformation, Priya finding her voice. They showed code, but more importantly, they showed the human decisions behind it.

"This nested IF statement," Alex said, pointing at the notorious seventeen-condition validator, "is ugly. But each condition has a comment with someone's name. The person who discovered why we needed it. Our code is a history of our team's learning."

Marcus jumped in: "Testing this monster required understanding not just the code, but the regulations, the edge cases, the business logic. It took our entire team to test one function properly."

They showed metrics, but not just performance stats. They showed team happiness scores, knowledge sharing graphs, the decrease in heroic 3 AM fixes.

"We used to have a bus factor of one," Alex explained. "Now it's seven. Not because we documented everything, but because we built it together."

The questions segment terrified Alex, but the queries were thoughtful, technical, genuine. A developer asked about rollback strategies, and Rita's design was perfect for the answer. Someone asked about team dynamics, and Sarah's psychological safety principles provided the framework.

"Last question," the moderator said. A young woman stood up.

"I'm a junior developer. My team doesn't collaborate like yours. How do I change that?"

Alex looked at Marcus, then at their team in the front row, then back at the questioner.

"Start small," Alex said. "Share one thing you learned each day. Ask for help even when you don't need it. Make your commits messages tell stories. Bring donuts. Make yourself vulnerable first, and others might follow."

"And if they don't?" she asked.

"Then find a team that will," Marcus said. "Life's too short to code alone."

The applause was thunderous. Alex and Marcus practically ran offstage, adrenaline and relief flooding through them.

"You were brilliant!" Sarah said, the team group-hugging them.

"I didn't die," Alex said, dazed.

"You did more than not die," Priya said. "You inspired people. The Slack channel for your talk has five hundred messages already."

They spent the rest of the conference being approached by developers, exchanging ideas, making connections. Alex discovered they actually enjoyed discussing technical challenges with peers who understood the complexity.

"You know what this means," Sarah said at the closing party.

"Never again?" Alex said hopefully.

"You're doing the keynote at DockerCon."

"I'm definitely quitting now."

But they were smiling. The kid who'd chosen MIT because it required minimal human interaction had just successfully presented to three thousand people.

That night, Alex received an email that stopped them cold:

"Alex - I watched your presentation online. I'm the junior developer who's been fixing bugs in the COBOL system since Dr. Montgomery left. I've been working alone for three years, afraid to ask for help because everyone says COBOL is dead. Your talk made me realize I've been creating my own isolation. Tomorrow, I'm asking my team to pair with me. Thank you for showing me it's okay to not know everything alone. - Kim Park, Legacy Systems Team"

Alex forwarded it to the team with a single comment: "This is why Sarah made us do this."

Sarah replied: "No, this is why you chose to do it well. You could have phoned it in. Instead, you changed someone's life."

Marcus added: "We changed someone's life. Team effort, remember?"

As Alex fell asleep in their hotel room, they realized something had fundamentally shifted. They weren't just a programmer anymore. They were a voice in the community, a mentor to strangers, a person who could inspire change.

It was terrifying.

It was also extraordinary.
